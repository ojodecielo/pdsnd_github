### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. They allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. It is possible to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, which allows for more flexibility in planning rides around the city.

The data for this project has been kindly provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. The system usage has been compared between three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
The descriptive statistical analysis is conducted with the help of a Python script **bikeshare.py**. The data files used for analysis are 
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
